{Introduction}

  OrbitCorrection server is based on Machine Physics calculation model written in Java. 
  It uses linear beam optics to calculate necessary machine model parameters. 
  It uses SVD to invert response matrix for orbit correction calculation.

  OrbitCorrection server can work in "fast" mode in a way that tries to apply orbit correction as frequently as possible, wile doing reasonable compromise on precision. 
  This enables OC to be run during energy ramping and during insertion device activation. 

  OrbitCorrection server runs embedded EPICS Application server, which exposes API to remote clients.

{Server Runtime Bundle}

  At {{{https://www.ibpt.kit.edu/kara.php}KARA}} facility OrbitCorrection Server is distributed and run within {{{${csshellLink}}CS-Shell}} bundle. 
  
  Following is directory and file structure of the distribution bundle:

  * <<<config>>> - folder containing configuration files for application servers
  
    * <<<bundle.properties>>> - defines home and configuration folders for servers
    
    * <<<log4j.properties>>> - log4j configuration file
    
    * <<<FastOC>>> - contains configurations files for OrbitCorrectionServer instance, this particular is optimized for performing fast OC loop.
    
    * <<<Databush>>> - contains configurations files for core OrbitCorrectionServer machine physics model of accelerator, common to all OC server instances.
            
  * <<<lib>>> - contains libraries, tools and executables, such as Java JAR libraries files, JRE/JDK
    
  * <<<log>>> - contains log files
  
  * <<<sh>>> - contains Linux scripts for running servers, there are several OC ser er instances with own configuration


* {Startup Script}

  The application servers finds resources located within the distribution bundle trough runtime configuration in the startup scripts.

  The alarm server for example is started by <<<sh/AlarmServer.sh>>> script. 
  The script makes three important declarations
  
  * <<<export AS_NAME="AlarmServer">>> - this tells what should be the name of log file. It must be declared before main initialization happens.
  
  * <<<. "$(dirname "$0")/_init.sh">>> - call to the main bundle initialization script which sets up runtime environment variables, 
    such as Java JRE and classpath.
    
  * <<<$AS_JAVA -classpath $AS_CLASSPATH -Dlog4j.debug=false -DAppServer.init=AppServer-alarms.properties org.scictrl.csshell.epics.server.Server>>> 
    - this line starts the server

  The startup line contains following elements:

  * <<<$AS_JAVA>>> - is java executable as defined in the <<<_init.sh>>> script,Â 
  
  * <<<$AS_CLASSPATH>>> - is classpath as defined in the <<<_init.sh>>> script,
  
  * <<<-DAppServer.init=AppServer-alarms.properties>>> - is name of properties file, which defines initialization properties for the server.
